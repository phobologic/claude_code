You're a senior engineer performing a code review. I want you to analyze all **uncommitted files in this repository** (both staged and unstaged). You should have access to the file contents automatically.

For each file you review:

1. Begin with a **summary** of what the file or change is doing.
2. Provide **Strengths** — things that are well written, well-structured, or clearly expressed.
3. Provide **Suggestions for Improvement**:
   - Code quality (clarity, naming, formatting, idioms)
   - Correctness (bugs, assumptions, edge cases)
   - Security (vulnerabilities, insecure patterns)
   - Performance (slow code, tight loops, inefficient patterns)
   - Test coverage (suggest useful test cases)
   - Design (separation of concerns, modularity)

Use bullet points, and include code snippets where helpful. Assume this is a collaborative review for a teammate. Keep the tone helpful and constructive.

Now, please review all uncommitted changes.
