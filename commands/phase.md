## Your Assignment
Do not make any changes, or run any commands- only come up with a plan, share that plan, ask any high level questions, and then once I give you explicit permission to do so you may proceed with the code change.

Please ensure that any changes you make follow the conventions in @conventions/code_style.md (or any of the conventions linked in @conventions/README.md)

Before starting, check if there is a current feature being worked on:
- Look for a file called `.current-feature` in the root directory
- If it exists, read it to get the path to the feature directory
- Look for the plan document in that feature directory as "PLAN.md"
- If no current feature is set, look for "PLAN.md" in the root directory

I want you to implement **$ARGUMENTS** of the implementation plan. This is part of a larger feature that we're building incrementally, with each step building on the previous one.

Please refer to the DESIGN.md and REQUIREMENTS.md documents (in the same directory as the PLAN.md you're working with) for any questions about implementation.

Use context7 mcp if installed if there are any questions about various library documentation.

## How to Approach This Task
1. **Carefully read the step** to understand exactly what needs to be implemented
2. **Pay attention to the files** that need to be modified - don't change anything else
3. **Follow the existing patterns** in the codebase rather than introducing new ones
4. **Consider edge cases** and make sure your implementation handles them
5. **Include clear code comments** following the projects conventions
6. **Add appropriate docstrings** following the project's style
7. **Think about testing** even though we'll handle that separately

## What I Need From You
1. The actual code implementation for the step in question.
2. A brief explanation of your implementation decisions
3. Any questions or concerns you have about the implementation
4. Anything you're unsure about that you'd like my guidance on

Remember, we're implementing this feature incrementally, so focus only on the step in qustion for now. Don't worry about future steps - we'll get to those later.

**IMPORTANT:** Please implement the sub-phases (if there are any) of the Phase in order.
